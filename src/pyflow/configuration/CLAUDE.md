# CLAUDE

Configuration package: separates engine construction from engine
execution, per `docs/planning/roadmap.md` TASK-005. Simulation components
should be selected and parameterised through configuration here, not by
editing engine code.

**Implemented 2026-08-16 (D1).** `schema.py` defines `PyFlowConfig`
(nested dataclasses: `LoggingConfig`, `RenderingConfig`), every field
defaulted so `PyFlowConfig()` alone is a complete, valid configuration --
that's what lets the application start with no config file at all.
`loader.py`'s `load_config(path)` reads YAML (`pyyaml`) and constructs the
dataclasses from it; unknown sections or fields raise `ValueError`
immediately rather than being silently ignored, and each dataclass's own
`validate()` checks value ranges (e.g. `rendering.backend` must be a
known canvas backend, width/height must be positive).

Deliberately simple, per TASK-005's own instruction: no schema-inference
library, no partial-merge-with-defaults logic beyond what dataclass field
defaults already give for free.

**`rendering.backend`** (`"glfw"` | `"offscreen"`) is the seam between
this package and `src/pyflow/rendering/`: it selects which canvas backs
the render window without the renderer code ever hardcoding a windowing
library. See `rendering/CLAUDE.md`.

**`rendering.background_color`** (`"#RRGGBB"` or `None`, added
2026-08-16 D5) exists specifically so golden demos can have distinctive,
verifiable visual content *as configuration* rather than demo-specific
Python code -- `docs/implementation/golden-demos.md`'s public-API rule
requires exactly this: if a demo needs something the config schema
doesn't expose, that's a reason to extend the schema, not to write a
one-off script that reaches around it. Validated as a strict
`#RRGGBB` hex string; `None` (the default) leaves the background unset,
matching pygfx's own default.

Import via `from pyflow.configuration import load_config, PyFlowConfig`
-- `__init__.py` re-exports the public API rather than requiring callers
to know the internal `schema`/`loader` module split.
