# CLAUDE

Core numerical engine: mesh, field storage, operator interfaces, time
integration, pressure-velocity coupling, linear solvers, boundary
conditions -- the reusable simulation machinery, independent of any
specific physics.

As of 2026-08-15, this package's scope also covers what were briefly
separate, undocumented `interaction/`, `io/`, `simulation/`, and `util/`
packages before that day's structural reconciliation (see
`docs/planning/backlog.md` §1 "TASK-000 package structure mismatch" and
`docs/CHANGELOG-DESIGN.md`): simulation-state I/O, the orchestration/
run-loop tying mesh+fields+time-stepping together, and shared low-level
utilities all live here for now. Split any of these back out into their
own package only once they've grown large enough to justify it -- don't
pre-emptively recreate the split without a documented reason next time.
